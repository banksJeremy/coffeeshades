First goal: convert entire CoffeeScript source tree to DOM tree. Ideally use jQuery data to actually link the
corresponding elements.

Second goal: come up with a nice visual way to represent the source without falling back to just text, where possible.

Later on: turn this into an editor. you should be able to make things more efficient, working on the source tree instead of raw text. Lispies sort-of get this with a good editor, but I haven't seen (nor looked for) something like this before.

It might be necessary to restrict the language in some ways to make this work... CoffeeScript is so flexible that coming up with a nice visual representation that can contain as much information as the text would be difficult. Or perhaps we would just optimize for restricted usage, but always have a mostly-plain-text fallback.
