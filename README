CoffeeShades
============

I'm experimenting with more visual representations of source code. I may decide to make an editor out of this if all goes well.

This is in HTML5, primarily targeting Google Chrome.

First target: Decent visualization of a narrow subset of CoffeeScript.
- Functions, but no splats or defaults.
- Calls, but no splats.
- Arithmatic.
- No properties or methods.
